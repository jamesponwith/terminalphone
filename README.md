# TerminalPhone

Encrypted push-to-talk voice communication over Tor hidden services.

TerminalPhone is a single, self-contained Bash script that provides anonymous, end-to-end encrypted voice and text communication between two parties over the Tor network. It operates as a walkie-talkie: you record a voice message, and it is compressed, encrypted, and transmitted to the remote party as a single unit. You can also send encrypted text messages during a call. No server infrastructure, no accounts, no phone numbers. Your Tor hidden service `.onion` address is your identity.

## Features

- **Walkie-Talkie Voice Messaging** -- Record a complete voice message and transmit it on release. No live streaming, no clipping.
- **In-Call Encrypted Chat** -- Send and receive encrypted text messages during a call. Press `T` to type a message.
- **Caller ID** -- Both parties automatically exchange `.onion` addresses on connect. The remote address is displayed in the call header.
- **Auto-Hangup Detection** -- When one party hangs up, the other is notified immediately and the call ends automatically.
- **Configurable Cipher** -- Choose from 21 curated ciphers ranked by strength (256-bit → 128-bit). Includes AES, ChaCha20, Camellia, and ARIA families. Weak ciphers (DES, RC4, ECB modes) are excluded.
- **Live Cipher Negotiation** -- Both parties exchange cipher information on connect. The call header shows both local and remote ciphers with green (match) or red (mismatch) indicators, updated in real time.
- **Mid-Call Settings** -- Press `S` during a call to access settings. Change your cipher on the fly; the remote party's display updates automatically.
- **Snowflake Bridge Info** -- When using Snowflake for censorship circumvention, the call page displays the bridge descriptor name, fingerprint, and transport connection status parsed from Tor's logs.
- **Auto-Listen** -- When enabled, a background listener starts automatically when Tor boots. Incoming calls are detected and accepted from the main menu without needing to manually select "Listen for calls". After a call ends, the listener restarts.
- **Configurable PTT Key** -- Change the push-to-talk key from the default spacebar to any key via the Settings menu.
- **Message Stats** -- The call screen displays the encrypted payload size for sent and received messages, updated in-place.
- **Connecting Animation** -- When calling a remote address, a cycling animation plays until the call interface loads.
- **Voice Changer** -- Apply voice effects to outgoing audio. Includes 6 presets (deep, high, robot, echo, whisper) and a fully configurable custom mode with pitch shift, overdrive, flanger, echo, highpass filter, and tremolo. Effects are processed using sox before Opus encoding.
- **Volume PTT (Termux)** -- Experimental mode that lets you double-tap the Volume Down button to toggle recording, even when Termux is in the background. Requires `jq` (installed on demand). Volume is automatically restored after each trigger.
- **Tor Hidden Service** -- Each instance runs its own Tor hidden service. Your `.onion` address serves as a permanent, routable endpoint. No port forwarding or public IP required.
- **End-to-End Encryption** -- All audio and text is encrypted using a configurable cipher (default: AES-256-CBC) with PBKDF2 key derivation from a pre-shared secret before entering the Tor network.
- **Low Bandwidth** -- Opus codec at 16kbps, 8kHz mono. A typical 10-second voice message is under 20KB, well within Tor's capacity.
- **Cross-Platform** -- Runs on standard Linux distributions and Android via Termux. Platform-specific audio backends are handled transparently.
- **No Root Required** -- PTT input uses terminal raw mode. No special permissions or kernel modules needed.
- **Single Script** -- One Bash file. No build system, no runtime, no framework.

## Installation

### Linux

**Supported distributions:** Debian/Ubuntu (apt), Fedora/RHEL (dnf), Arch (pacman).

``` bash

git clone https://gitlab.com/here_forawhile/terminalphone.git
cd terminalphone
bash terminalphone.sh

```

Select option **7** from the menu to install all dependencies automatically. The following packages will be installed:

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tor` | Onion routing and hidden service |
| `opus-tools` | Voice compression (Opus codec) |
| `sox` | Audio processing utilities |
| `socat` | Bidirectional TCP relay through Tor SOCKS proxy |
| `openssl` | AES-256-CBC encryption and decryption |
| `alsa-utils` | Audio recording and playback (`arecord`, `aplay`) |

### Termux (Android)

TerminalPhone supports Android devices through Termux. Due to Android's sandboxed audio architecture, two additional components are required.

**Step 1: Install Termux**

Install [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) from F-Droid. Do not use the Play Store version, as it is outdated and no longer receives updates.

**Step 2: Install the Termux:API app**

Install [Termux:API](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux.api/) from F-Droid. This is a separate Android application (not a Termux package) that provides a bridge between Termux and Android system APIs. TerminalPhone requires it to access the device microphone and media playback.

Without the Termux:API app installed on the device, the `termux-microphone-record` and `termux-media-player` commands will not function, and audio recording and playback will fail silently.

After installing the Termux:API app, grant it microphone permissions when prompted.

**Step 3: Install the Termux:API package inside Termux**

```bash
pkg install termux-api
```

This installs the command-line utilities that communicate with the Termux:API app.

**Step 4: Run TerminalPhone**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd terminalphone
bash terminalphone.sh
```

Select option **7** to install all remaining dependencies. The installer will run `pkg upgrade` first to resolve any package linking issues, then install `tor`, `opus-tools`, `sox`, `socat`, `openssl-tool`, `ffmpeg`, and `termux-api`.

**Termux-specific dependencies:**

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `termux-api` | CLI bridge to Android microphone and media player |
| `ffmpeg` | Converts Android's M4A recordings to raw PCM for Opus encoding |

---

## Quick Start

```
1. Run:                bash terminalphone.sh
2. Install deps:       Select option 7
3. Start Tor:          Select option 8 (wait for 100% bootstrap)
4. Set shared secret:  Select option 4 (both parties must use the same secret)
5. Share your .onion address with the other party (option 3)

To receive a call:     Select option 1 (Listen for calls)
To make a call:        Select option 2 (Call an onion address)
```

Both parties must have Tor running and the same shared secret configured before initiating a call.

---

## Usage

### Menu Options

```
 1  Listen for calls          Wait for an incoming connection
 2  Call an onion address     Connect to a remote .onion endpoint
 3  Show my onion address     Display your current .onion address
 4  Set shared secret         Configure the pre-shared encryption key
 5  Test audio (loopback)     Record and play back audio locally
 6  Show status               Display Tor, secret, and connection status
 7  Install dependencies      Install all required packages
 8  Start Tor                 Start the Tor process and hidden service
 9  Stop Tor                  Stop the Tor process
10  Restart Tor               Stop and restart Tor
11  Rotate onion address      Generate a new .onion address (destroys the old one)
12  Settings                  Configure cipher, Opus quality, Snowflake, auto-listen, PTT key, voice changer, volume PTT
 0  Quit                      Stop Tor and exit
```

### In-Call Controls

**Linux (hold-to-talk):**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Hold SPACE | Record voice message. Sends automatically on release. |
| T | Send an encrypted text message. |
| S | Open settings mid-call (change cipher, adjust quality). |
| Q | Hang up and return to the menu. |

**Termux (toggle mode):**

Android's software keyboard sends key events on release, not on press. TerminalPhone adapts by using toggle mode on Termux.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Tap SPACE | Start recording. Tap again to stop and send. |
| T | Send an encrypted text message. |
| S | Open settings mid-call (change cipher, adjust quality). |
| Q | Hang up and return to the menu. |
| Vol Down ×2 | Toggle recording via volume button (requires Volume PTT enabled in settings). |

### CLI Mode

```bash
bash terminalphone.sh install       # Install dependencies
bash terminalphone.sh test          # Audio loopback test
bash terminalphone.sh status        # Show status
bash terminalphone.sh listen        # Listen for incoming calls
bash terminalphone.sh call ADDRESS  # Call a .onion address
```

## How It Works

TerminalPhone uses a record-then-send model. When you activate PTT, the microphone records continuously until you release. The complete recording is then processed through the following pipeline:

```
SENDER                                          RECEIVER
──────                                          ────────
Microphone                                      Speaker
    │                                               ▲
    ▼                                               │
Raw PCM (8kHz, 16-bit, mono)                    Opus decode
    │                                               ▲
    ▼                                               │
Opus encode (16kbps)                            AES-256-CBC decrypt
    │                                               ▲
    ▼                                               │
AES-256-CBC encrypt                             Base64 decode
    │                                               ▲
    ▼                                               │
Base64 encode ──▶ socat ──▶ Tor ──▶ socat ──▶ Receive
```

The wire protocol is line-based text over a TCP connection:

| Message | Description |
|---|---|
| `ID:<onion>` | Caller ID -- sender's `.onion` address |
| `CIPHER:<name>` | Sender's encryption cipher. Exchanged on connect and on change. |
| `PTT_START` | Sender has begun recording |
| `PTT_STOP` | Sender has finished; audio follows or has been sent |
| `AUDIO:<base64>` | Complete encrypted audio message |
| `MSG:<base64>` | Encrypted text message |
| `HANGUP` | Sender is disconnecting |
| `PING` | Keepalive signal |

On Termux, an additional conversion step handles Android's native M4A recording format, using `ffmpeg` to convert to raw PCM before Opus encoding.

---

## Security Model

**Encryption:** All audio is encrypted with a user-configurable cipher (default: AES-256-CBC) before transmission. 21 curated ciphers are available, ranked from strongest (256-bit) to adequate (128-bit). The key is derived from a pre-shared secret using PBKDF2 with 10,000 iterations. The encryption is applied at the application layer, independent of Tor's transport encryption.

**Cipher negotiation:** Both parties exchange cipher names on connect and whenever a cipher is changed mid-call. Cipher names are not secret (Kerckhoffs's principle). If the local and remote ciphers do not match, both parties see red indicators in the call header.

**Transport:** All data is routed through Tor hidden service circuits. Neither party's IP address is exposed. There is no clearnet traffic. The connection cannot be attributed to either party by a network observer.

**Traffic analysis resistance:** The record-then-send model produces irregular transmission patterns (variable-length messages at irregular intervals), which are harder to fingerprint than continuous streaming.

**Authentication:** The shared secret serves as implicit authentication. If both parties do not have the same secret, decryption fails and no audio is played. On connect, both parties exchange `.onion` addresses for caller identification.

**Limitations:**

- The shared secret must be exchanged out-of-band through a secure channel (in person, encrypted messaging, etc.).
- There is no forward secrecy. If the shared secret is compromised, all past and future communications using that secret can be decrypted.
- The protocol does not protect against a compromised endpoint. If either device is compromised, the attacker has access to the plaintext audio.

---

## Configuration

All configuration is stored in `.terminalphone/` relative to the script location:

```
.terminalphone/
  tor_data/            Tor data directory and hidden service keys
  audio/               Temporary audio files (cleaned on exit)
  pids/                Process ID tracking
  shared_secret        Encrypted shared secret file
  torrc                Generated Tor configuration
```

Default audio parameters (defined at the top of the script):

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LISTEN_PORT` | 7777 | TCP port for incoming connections |
| `TOR_SOCKS_PORT` | 9050 | Tor SOCKS proxy port |
| `OPUS_BITRATE` | 16 | Opus encoding bitrate in kbps |
| `CIPHER` | aes-256-cbc | Encryption cipher (configurable via Settings) |
| `SNOWFLAKE_ENABLED` | 0 | Snowflake bridge for censorship circumvention |
| `AUTO_LISTEN` | 0 | Auto-listen for calls when Tor starts |
| `PTT_KEY` | SPACE | Push-to-talk key (configurable via Settings) |
| `VOL_PTT` | 0 | Volume-down double-tap PTT, Termux only (experimental) |
| `SAMPLE_RATE` | 8000 | Audio sample rate in Hz |
| `CHUNK_DURATION` | 1 | Duration for audio test chunks in seconds |

---

## Troubleshooting

**Tor fails to bootstrap:**
Check the Tor log at `.terminalphone/tor_data/tor.log`. Common causes include clock skew, network restrictions blocking Tor, or another Tor instance using the same SOCKS port.

**No audio on Termux:**
Verify that the Termux:API app is installed from F-Droid (not just the `termux-api` package). Grant microphone permissions to the Termux:API app in Android settings. Run the audio loopback test (option 5) to verify.

**ffmpeg installation fails on Termux:**
Run `pkg upgrade` before installing dependencies. The installer does this automatically, but if you installed packages manually, outdated shared libraries can cause linking errors.

**Audio test works but calls are silent:**
Confirm that both parties are using the same shared secret. Mismatched secrets will result in decryption failure with no error message -- the call connects but no audio is heard.

**Snowflake bridge is slow to connect:**
Snowflake routes traffic through WebRTC proxies, which adds extra bootstrapping time. It is normal for Tor to take 30--60 seconds (or more) to reach 100% when Snowflake is enabled. The script will display a patience notice during bootstrap.

**Hang up does not return to menu:**
If the script hangs after pressing Q, press Ctrl+C to force cleanup and return to the shell.
